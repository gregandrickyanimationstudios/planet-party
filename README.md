# Venus Palooza Party 🚀🪐

Welcome to the **Venus Palooza Party** website!

This project was originally created on Google Sites as a fun, informational site all about **Venus** — the planet, and of course the party! 🎉  
The goal of this site is to teach visitors about Venus in a light‑hearted way and invite them to the *Venus Palooza Party* — whether that party is real or metaphorical. 🙂
